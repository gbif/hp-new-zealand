# Status 
This is a draft high level roadmap that focuses on five goals to meet the vision and outcomes, and shows the alignment of areas of activity to these goals.

# Goals (draft)

* **Empower**: Create a coordinated and sustainable community of data holders, biodiversity and biodiversity informatics experts data users and decision makers
* **Improve**:  improve capacity and capability;  provide and enhance abilities to support data mobilisation
* **Promote**: increase awareness of the value and availability, and use of biodiversity data
* **Mobilise**: encourage and support delivery of New Zealand's primary biodiveristy data
* **Enhance**:  Support data publishers to improve the quality and scope of biodiversity data they mobilise;  Identify and remove barriers for mobilisation.

## Roadmap (Indicative)

The timing of activities can be aligned against phases of implementation.  

<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Phase</th>
        <th>Theme</th>
        <th>Indicative timing</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Establish</td>
        <td>Establish processes, programmes and infrastucture to support GBIF New Zealand</td>
        <td>2021-2023</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Engage</td>
        <td>Building participation in, and awareness of, GBIF New Zealand</td>
        <td>2023-2024</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Mobilise</td>
        <td>Work with the community to build capacity and support mobilisation of datasets.</td>
        <td>2024-2026</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Mature</td>
        <td>Work with the community to review progress and plan the next steps, whilst still continuing to support mobilisation and capacity building.</td>
        <td>2025-</td>
    </tr>
</table>

The table below indicates the level of effort that might reasonably expected against these phases.  It should be noted that these phases are likely to overlap or grade into each other.
