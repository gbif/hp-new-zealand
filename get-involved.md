There are multiple ways you can get involved.  The sections below provide a brief description of the main ways you can participate.

### Make use of the biodiversity data
Use the data mobilised through the GBIF to support your research or interests, and then acknowledge the use of that data.
For more information see [Using data](/using-data).  

### Mobilise your biodiversity data
Become a data publisher by mobilising the biodversity data that your organisation holds through the GBIF network.  For more information see [Mobilising Biodiversity Data](/mobilising).
