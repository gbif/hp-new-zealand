# Identify data sets

A first key step to mobilising your data is to identify which biodiversity datasets you can mobilise through GBIF.  By working through each data set you will have information accessible for the subsequent steps, and make it easier to reach out to us for help worked through the datasets it will help. 

  * Is the dataset relevant to GBIF's scope and objectives?
  * Does the dataset fit one of the [classes of dataset accepted by GBIF](https://www.gbif.org/dataset-classes)?  For digitised resources, these are based around a central core, being one of Occurrence, Checklist or Event.  For undigitised resources it is possible to create 'metadata-only' records.
  * What are the Intelluctation Property rights on the dataset?
    * Do you have the authority to publish the data?  Or will the publication of the dataset require prior approval from another person(s) and/or organisation(s)?
    * Is the dataset able to be publish under a CC0, CC BY or CC BY-NC license?
  * Should the dataset be published with open access?
     * Does the dataset contain sensitive or personal information? 
     * Could some data be generalised or removed to protect sensitive components whilst still maintaining value to data users?
  

# Secure institutional agreements
Once you decide to share data through the GBIF network, you obtain the necessary agreements from your institution to publish on behalf of the institution.

GBIF only accepts data published by organisations, therefore individuals wishing to publish data need to work with an affiliated organisation or consider submitting a [data paper](https://www.gbif.org/data-papers) to an appropriate journals.

how to start
* organisations register on the GBIF site and request endorsement as a data provider.  This requires the completetion of an online form

* Prepare metadata
* Prepare data
  * accessible format
  * map to standards
* establish provider or contact host provider
* submit request to become provider
* Get someone to review your data...
* respond to data quality/mapping feedback in timely manner



# endorsement

Published data are relevant to GBIF's scope and objectives

Data hosting arrangements are stable and persistent

Data publishing and use are supported by strong national, regional and thematic engagement

Data are as open as possible, and available for sharing and reuse

Data publishers can respond to feedback and improve data quality

Considerations prior to publishing a data sets.


# Legal Considerations

## IP and Owership

* Data rights -- licenses, permisions to share
* Sensitivity in the data

## Re-use and attribution of the data

cc licensing

# Characteristics of the data set

## Type of data

* Occurrence data
* Sampling events
* Species lists
* Species lists

## Scope and Maintance
* Data set complete -- not changing over time
* Long term resource -- how will data set be maintained, contacts etc


# Data quality
