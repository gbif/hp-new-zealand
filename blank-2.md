* his recognition can be further developed if you author a peer-reviewed data paper, giving scholarly recognition to the publication of biodiversity datasets.
* **demonstrate value of the data through usage**:   and citations of digitized data published from their institutions and accessed through GBIF and similar infrastructures.
* enable your data to be integrated with data held all over the world to be integrated, revealing new opportunities for collaboration among data owners and researchers.
