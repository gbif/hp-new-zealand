## Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF)

The Global Biodiversity Information Facility, usually known as GBIF, is an international network and data infrastructure for biodiversity data that is funded by governments around the world.  It aims at providing anyone, anywhere, open access to data about all types of life on Earth.

GBIF works though a Secretariat (hosted in Copenhagen) and a network of participating countries, organisations and data holding institutes.  Data holding institues, or Publishers, provide open access to the biodiversity datasets held by their institutions using common standards, and under a Create Commons license.   GBIF draws these data sources together and creates an index of hundreds of millions of species occurrence records.  Open access and the aggregation of this data s enables scientists, researchers and other communities to more easily access and utilise these data.  This is demonstrated by the use of the data in hundreds of peer-reviewed publications and policy papers each year which cover topics from the impacts of climate change and the spread of invasive and alien pests to priorities for conservation and protected areas, food security and human health.

## GBIF New Zealand
Aotearoa New Zealand has been a participant in GBIF since 2001 and established a national node, GBIF New Zealand, in 2002.  However GBIF New Zealand has had a limited web presence until 2022 and has primarily functioned to support the mobilisation of biodiversity datasets held by New Zealand institutes.  

GBIF New Zealand is supported by the Ministry for Business, Innovation & Employment (MBIE).  MBIE makes the appoints the formal roles required to participate in the GBIF network (ie., Head of Delegation and Node Manager), and oversees the work programme for GBIF New Zealand.

In 2021 GBIF New Zealand participated in GBIF's hosted node initiative resulting in the development of a New Zealand portal. GBIF New Zealand hopes this portal, which is hosted on GBIF infrastructure,  will raise awareness and use of the biodiversity data that are being mobilised, and that it will help to stimulate the development of a community of biodiversity data users and publishers.
