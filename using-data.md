## Accessing Data
The main ways to access data in the GBIF network are:
* using the [Data](/Data).  This is pre-filtered to biodiversity data records for Aotearoa New Zealand.
* using the main [GBIF site](https://www.gbif.org/).  This provides a rich interface to search and filter data from around the globe.
* using the GBIF API.  Please visit the GBIF website for [API documentation](https://www.gbif.org/developer/summary).

## Acknowleding use of GBIF-mediate data

There is no cost for data accessed through the GBIF network, use of the daincluding GBI-NZ, is free for all—but not free of obligations. Under the terms of the GBIF [data user agreement](https://www.gbif.org/terms/data-user), users who download individual datasets or search results and use them in research or policy agree to cite them using a DOI, or Digital Object Identifier.

Good citation practices ensure scientific transparency and reproducibility by guiding other researchers to the original sources of information. They also reward data-publishing institutions and individuals by reinforcing the value of sharing open data and demonstrating its impact to their stakeholders and funders. Datasets published through GBIF are authored electronic data publications and, as such, should be treated as first-class research outputs and correctly cited.

Recommendations for citing data downloads, data sets, GBIF website content can be found on the GBIF website at [Citation guidelines](https://www.gbif.org/citation-guidelines).
