The 2025  Ebbe Nielsen Challenge is now open, inviting submissions that advance open science and biodiversity informatics by developing innovative applications of freely and openly available biodiversity data.

Now in its tenth year, the Challenge celebrates the legacy of Ebbe Nielsen and promotes creative use of biodiversity data through open science.
Entries are encouraged from individuals or teams working on projects that leverage GBIF-mediated data and tools to support biodiversity discovery, monitoring, conservation, policy, and education.

### Key Dates
- **Submission deadline:** 7 September 2025, 23:59 CEST (09:59 NZST on 8 September)
- **Prize pool:** €25,000
- **Winners announced:** October 2025 during GBIF Governing Board 32 in Bogotá, Colombia

### Submissions
Eligible submissions may include, but are not limited to:
- Software tools or web applications
- Visualisations or dashboards
- Analytical workflows or scripts
- Interactive platforms
- AI or machine learning applications
- Tools that support integration with Indigenous knowledge systems

### Why apply?
This is an exciting opportunity to gain international recognition, connect with the global biodiversity informatics community, and help shape the future of biodiversity data use. Early-career researchers, postgraduate students, and innovators in Aotearoa are especially encouraged to apply. You don’t need to be affiliated with a university or research organisation to enter—just bring a great idea and demonstrate its potential.

Entries will be judged on:
- Openness and repeatability
- Innovation and novelty
- Relevance and impact
- Functionality and usability

New Zealand has not yet had a winning entry in the Challenge. We encourage submissions from across Aotearoa, including postgraduate students, early-career researchers, and those working in biodiversity data, digital tools, and environmental science.
