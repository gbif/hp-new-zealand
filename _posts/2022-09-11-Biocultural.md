News item about Local context

Local Contexts supports Indigenous communities to manage their intellectual and cultural property, cultural heritage, environmental data and genetic resources within digital environments. Local Contexts recognizes the inherent sovereignty that Indigenous communities have over knowledge and data that comes from their lands, territories, and waters.

The Local Contexts Hub provides an interface to apply the Traditional Knowledge (TK) and Biocultural (BC) Notices and Labels to ground Indigenous data sovereignty.
