Biocultural Labels - a practical mechanism to advance aspirations for Indigenous data sovereignty.

Local Contexts was founded in 2010 focussed on increasing Indigenous involvement in data governance through the integration of Indigenous values into data systems. Local Contexts offers digital strategies for Indigenous communities, cultural institutions and researchers through the TK (Traditional Knowledge) & BC (Biocultural) Labels and Notices. Together they function as a practical mechanism to advance aspirations for Indigenous data sovereignty and Indigenous innovation.

The Local Contexts project grew from the needs of Indigenous and local organizations who wanted a practical method to deal with the range of intellectual property issues that arise in relation to managing cultural heritage materials. Emerging from Mukurtu CMS platform's use of traditional knowledge fields to incorporate traditional knowledge and copyright concerns, Local Contexts started as a way to provide strategies for managing, sharing, and protecting digital heritage. In an increasingly complex legal, social and cultural environment, the TK (Traditional Knowledge) & BC (Biocultural) Labels offer Indigenous communities the tools to add cultural and historical context and political authority to cultural heritage content in non-Indigenous digital archives, libraries, museums and other digital repositories globally as well as to their own local digital heritage archives. 

The BC (Biocultural) Labels extend the TK Label initiative to genetic resources and within the biological and genomic data sciences. The BC Labels were conceptualized and developed by Jane Anderson and Maui Hudson in 2019. Focused on accurate provenance, transparency and integrity in research engagements with Indigenous communities, this initiative offers the possibility for substantive change in how biological data from Indigenous contexts can maintain cultural relationships and responsibilities, connecting Indigenous people and places over time with data and in the metadata and with future researchers for the cultural, ecological and commercial benefit of Indigenous peoples. The BC Labels have broad international interest and are being initially piloted in Aotearoa, New Zealand with new use cases developing in the US, Australia and Canada.

Local Contexts supports Indigenous communities to manage their intellectual and cultural property, cultural heritage, environmental data and genetic resources within digital environments. Local Contexts recognizes the inherent sovereignty that Indigenous communities have over knowledge and data that comes from their lands, territories, and waters.

The Local Contexts Hub provides an interface to apply the Traditional Knowledge (TK) and Biocultural (BC) Notices and Labels to ground Indigenous data sovereignty.
