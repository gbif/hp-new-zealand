The National Environmental Data Centre (NEDC) aims to provide easy access to environmental datasets held by New Zealand's seven Crown Research Institute (CRI).  

NEDC is a website resulting from a collaboration of NZ's seven CRIs and lists a range of datasets that are that hold.  The datasets listed by NEDC cover a range of environmental information domains including the atmosphere, biodiversity, climate, freshwater, geology, land and ocean.  The resources within each of these categories are briefly described and a link to provided that takes the user directly to the resource. 

NEDC partners hope that increased awareness and access provide by the site will be of "benefit not only to advance science, but also for a myriad of uses by Māori, central and regional government, businesses, researchers and the general public".
