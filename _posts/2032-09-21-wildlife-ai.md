GBIF New Zealand welcomes [wildlife.ai](https://www.wildlife.ai/) as a new publisher.

wildlife.ai is a charitable trust that is using artifical intelligence to help protect our biodiversity.

Based in Taranaki, wildlife ai is engaged in collaborative projects around Aotearoa New Zealand that are monitoring fish ([Spyfish Aotearoa](https://www.wildlife.ai/projects/spyfish-aotearoa/)), Weta and other ground dwelling invertebrates ([Weta Watcher](https://www.wildlife.ai/projects/weta-watcher/)) and working to identify individual Archey's frog's, a threatened endemic species.  wildlife.ai is also collaborative on overseas project ([Koster Observatory](https://www.wildlife.ai/projects/koster-observatory/)) and on educational resources ([Kiwi or Stoat?](https://www.wildlife.ai/courses/identifying-photographs-of-animals-kiwi-or-stoat/)).

wildlife.org has adopted an open-source approach to their machine learning solutions.  Victor Anton, the general manager of wildlife.ai, says they are keen to apply an open-data approach to the observations they collect, and that make the data available via the GBIF-network seemed an obvious step.  

wildlife.org plans on publishing their first dataset to GBIF before 2023.  This dataset will be <<automated observations from Spyfish Aotearoa captured at Goat Island from XXX to XXX.  They will then progressively publish additional data sets as XXXX>>.
